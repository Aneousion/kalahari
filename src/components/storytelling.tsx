                    Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a severe threat to global health, particularly in Africa, where a group of pathogens is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The bacteria <em>Enterococcus faecium</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Enterobacter cloacae</em>, and <em>Escherichia coli</em> (collectively known as ESKAPE-E pathogens) are among the most critical contributors to this burden. These species, listed as global priority pathogens by the WHO, are prevalent in both hospital and community settings, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations like infants and the immunocompromised.
                    <br /><br />
                    Recent studies, such as Ayobami et al. (2022), emphasize the urgent need for vaccine development targeting these pathogens. Sartorius et al. (2024) revealed that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are the most common pathogen-drug combinations driving deaths due to AMR across 25 and 16 African countries, respectively. Combined, these pathogens account for 53% and 34% of AMR-related deaths across 47 African countries.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our work aims to support the development of vaccines for multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and encourages the need for a repository of potential vaccine targets, a crucial step towards combating the growing AMR crisis in Africa.
